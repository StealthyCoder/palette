# StealthyCoder Palette

This repo will contain a somewhat universal palette, like [`catppuccin`](https://github.com/catppuccin), but then for all kinds of esoteric and well-known purposes.

# Layout

The layout will be in each folder there will be a file describing how to use or configure the palette. Then it will also have a screenshot preview of what it will look like.
Then the actual files needed will also be contained in there.

> A note on the screenshot. I noticed taking screenshots does not necessarily convey the accurate result.

## Palette

This will contain the universal palette, including background colour, text colours and so on.
It will use a dark purple, orange, yellow and maybe gold colours.

## YSMenu

This will contain some images plus some colours for the YSMenu used on a DS.

## Windows 3.11

This will contain two VGA 8-bit 256 color based one palettes for Windows 3.11.

- For modern monitors
- For CRT/CRT-emulated monitors

## Windows 95/98

This will contain a palette/setup for Windows 95/98.

- a VGA 8-bit 256 color based one for modern monitors
- a VGA 8-bit 256 color based one for CRT/CRT-emulated monitors
- a SVGA 16-bit 65.536 color based one
- a SVGA 32-bit 16.777.216 color based one

## MS-DOS

This will contain a palette/setup for MS-DOS, and also a `PROMPT` configuration.
That what is shown as the actual prompt.

- ANSI one
- ~non-ANSI one~
  This is sadly not possible. A possibility is to have the source code or binary to a program to change the color using DOS interrupts.

## TTY

For some tty on Linux, `kitty`, `terminal` and maybe some more. Otherwise just the simple `base16` setup in terms of color so people can port it themselves.

## Powershell

If Powershell can be configured on Windows, then I will try to make a palette for that.

## Android

Try to see if I can make a Palette for the Android UI, so you can use it on your phone.

## Stylus

See if I can do some sites and present them in there as well.
